# V003 - Function added

* Code: V003
* Level: MINOR
* Rule: Function added

## Description

The addition of a new method, as long as it is namespaced, should not result in any issue. Existing code should not be aware of this new feature, thus no code depends on it.

However, new functionality is added. From an API perspective, this function is now available for use (thus not hidden from the client).

* [MINOR] Adds functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
